= Migrating from old pipeline setups
:toc:
:!toc-title:
:!toc-placement:

In this guide, you will set up the new pipeline and remove the old one.

Each step in this guide is equivalent to one commit on master, to make sure the process works nicely.

toc::[]

== Make sure you're on the correct branch

These steps are going to happen on the master branch.
This is to make sure that all the steps get built and deployed in the correct order.

So to make sure you're on the correct branch, let's switch now!

[source, bash]
----
git switch master
----

== Add the required modules for your new pipeline

Now, we need to add the new pipeline, so it's ready to go for the latter steps.

In your *service* account (`terraform/service/main.tf`), you have to add the following terraform:

[source, hcl]
----
module "deployment_pipeline" {
  # TODO: Make sure that you change the `ref` to the latest release!
  source = "github.com/nsbno/terraform-aws-delivery-pipeline?ref=x.y.z"

  name_prefix = "deployment"
  deployment_accounts = {
    service = local.service_account_id
    test = local.test_account_id
    stage = local.stage_account_id
    prod = local.prod_account_id
  }
  deployment_role = "deployment-trusted-deployment"

  account_id = local.service_account_id
  subnets = module.vpc.public_subnet_ids
}
----

In addition to that, your CI has to be able to trigger the new pipeline.

[source, hcl]
----
# The CI must be able to trigger a deployment.
resource "aws_iam_user_policy" "machine_user_lambda" {
  user = module.ci_machine_user.user_name
  policy = data.aws_iam_policy_document.machine_user_lambda.json
}

data "aws_iam_policy_document" "machine_user_lambda" {
  statement {
    effect = "Allow"
    actions = ["lambda:InvokeFunction"]
    resources = [module.deployment_pipeline.orchestrator_lambda_arn]
  }
}

----

Now you have to add roles to all your accounts.
That means in `terraform/service/main.tf` and `terraform/template/main.tf`.

[source, hcl]
----
module "deployment_pipeline_permissions" {
  # TODO: Make sure that you change the `ref` to the latest release!
  source = "github.com/nsbno/terraform-aws-delivery-pipeline?ref=x.y.z/extras/permissions"

  name_prefix = "deployment"
  service_account_id = local.service_account_id
}
----

Now, we can commit and push the changes!

[source, bash]
----
git add .
git commit -m "Add new deployment pipeline and accompanying permissions"
git push
----

== Enable the deployment pipeline for each repo

Now it is time to change how you actually do deploys!

For every repository you want to deploy, you have to add a `.deployment/config.yaml` file.

[source, yaml]
----
version: 0.1

applications:
  ecr:
    - name: your-ecr-repo-name
      tag: master-branch

deployment:
  steps:
    - deploy_terraform:
        version: 1.0.0

flow:
  - [service, test, stage]
  - prod
----

And modify your CircleCI build.
In this example, your old code goes where the `# [...]` is.
If you have any `stepfunction-ci` orb steps, remove those as well.

[source, yaml]
----

parameters:
  # [...]
  terraform_version:
    type: string
    default: "1.0.0"
  artifact_bucket:
    type: string
    default: "125515308255-deployment-delivery-pipeline-artifacts"
  deploy_function_name:
    type: string
    default: "deployment-delivery-pipeline-orchestrator"

orbs:
  # [...]
  terraform: circleci/terraform@3.0.0
  deployment: vydev/deployment@0.1.0

workflows:
  version: 2
  build-and-deploy:
    jobs:
      # [...]
      - terraform/validate:
          checkout: true
          tag: << pipeline.parameters.terraform_version >>
          backend: false
          matrix:
            parameters:
              path:
                - terraform/service
                - terraform/test
                - terraform/stage
                - terraform/prod
      - deployment/build-and-upload-repo:
          s3_bucket: << pipeline.parameters.artifact_bucket >>
          requires:
            - terraform/validate
          filters:
            branches:
              only: master
      - deployment/trigger-deployment:
          lambda: << pipeline.parameters.deploy_function_name >>
          requires:
            - deployment/build-and-upload-repo
          filters:
            branches:
              only: master
----

Now, commit and push to apply the changes:

[source, bash]
----
git add .
git commit -m "Move deployment to new deployment pipeline"
git push
----


== Remove the old deployment pipeline

Now that all repositories have been moved over and tested with the new pipeline, it is time to remove the old pipeline.
This is the fun part, because we will be removing more than 1000 lines of code üòç

This step isn't the easiest to show, so take a look at link:https://github.com/nsbno/rollingstock-aws/commit/0dc70a4c958b2e1127a331c13f0e8f372d40d09a[commit 0dc70a in nsbno/rollingstock-aws] to get some guidance.
If you're unsure, please don't hesitate to ask in #team-infrastructure-public!

Now, once everything is removed, commit and push:

[source, bash]
----
git add .
git commit -m "Remove everything related to the old pipeline"
git push
----

And now, you're fully migrated! üéâ
