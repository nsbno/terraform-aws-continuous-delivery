= Pipeline Architecture

== Responsibilities

The principle here is to have the CI engine do the bulk of the work, and then

CircleCI::
* Responsible for the flow of integration and deployment.

AWS Pipeline::
* Responsible for actually deploying resources.
* Check if test and stage got updated before production (IMPORTANT)
