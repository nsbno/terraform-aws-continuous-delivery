== About

This module gives your environment a deployment pipeline for your applications.
Using a simple YAML file, you can deploy any repo you want!

Here is how simple it can be to deploy a terraform repository:
[source,yaml]
----
# .deployment/config.yaml

# This defines what each environment should do on deployment.
deployment:
  steps:
    - deploy_terraform:
        version: 1.0.8

# This is the order that deployments happen.
# In this case it's first service, test and stage that gets deployed.
# Production then deploys when those are successful.
flow:
  - [service, test, stage]
  - prod
----

== Examples

In the link:examples/[examples directory] you can find multiple examples.
These can be helpful to set up the pipeline in your own team!

link:examples/pipeline_setup[Pipeline Setup]::
This example shows you how to set up the pipeline for your account set.
It is specifically for your `<team>-aws` repository.

link:examples/microservice[Microservice Deployment]::
In this example, you can see how to deploy a simple microservice.

== Features

The pipeline has some features that make your life easier.
All the following examples are top level stanzas that you can just drop right into your configuration.

=== Deployment Order

Deploy your environments in any order you want!
Want to be a madman and deploy production first?
Go ahead (but please don't).

[source,yaml]
----
flow:
  - [service, test, stage]
  - prod
----

=== Keep Versions Up To Date

Specify applications you want to always keep up to date, based on a tag.
Now you can access the current deployed version via a SSM parameter - `${var.name_prefix}/${var.application_name}`!

[source,yaml]
----
# Specify the applications you want to bump
applications:
  ecr:
    - name: demo-container
      tag_filters: [master-branch]
  lambda:
    - name: demo-serverless
      tag_filters: [master-branch]
  frontend:
    - name: demo-frontend
      tag_filters: [master-branch]

steps:
  # Activate automatic version bumping in the pipeline
  - bump_versions
  - # [...]
----

== Deploy Terraform

Terraform deployments are easier than ever

[source, yaml]
----
steps:
    - deploy_terraform:
        version: 1.1.0
        # This is optional! The default is `terraform`.
        # Each environment specified under "flow" must have its own folder in this directory.
        directory: environments

flow:
  - service
  - [test, stage]
  - prod
----

== Migrate from old pipeline

If you're using the old pipeline setup, we have a guide to follow to get you up to date with this one!
